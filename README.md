# Encryption Demos

Some interactive demos of simple symmetric key substitution cyphers

At present:

- Caesar Cypher
- Vign√®re Cypher

Text can be eneterd into either the plaintext or cyphertext inputs, keys adjusted, etc. The encryption system is shown and updates as text is typed. 

Also shown is a letter frequency chart to help show how each scheme would be susceptible / resist a frequency analysis attack.
